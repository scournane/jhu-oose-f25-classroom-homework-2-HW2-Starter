 Benefits:
 -  Client handles the UI while the server handles the logic and data.  
 - Since the client only needs to talk to the server’s API, you can build any UI on any platform and still access the same data.

Drawbacks:

 -  If the server crashes or goes down, all clients lose access.
 - Requests must travel across the internet and wait for server responses, which can slow the performance.
